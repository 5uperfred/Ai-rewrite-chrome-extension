# Contributing to the AI Text Rewriter (Gemini Edition) ✨🎉

So, you've looked at this glorious mess of code and thought, "I can make this *even better* (or maybe just less likely to spontaneously combust 🔥)"? **Awesome!** We genuinely appreciate you wanting to lend your brainpower (and keystrokes) to this little project. 🙏

Contributing here should be relatively painless, maybe even fun? 🤷‍♀️ This document outlines how you can help, from squashing bugs that crawl out of the woodwork 🐛 to suggesting features that are *obviously* missing (like a "Translate to Pirate" mode 🏴‍☠️ - just kidding... unless?).

## Code of Conduct (AKA "Don't Be a Jerk" Policy) 🤝💖

We haven't written a formal `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` yet (because, frankly, who has the time?), but the basic principle applies: **Be excellent to each other.** Treat everyone with respect. No flame wars, no trolling, just constructive collaboration. We're all here because we think making writing slightly less soul-crushing is a neat idea. Let's keep it friendly! If things get heated, step away, grab a ☕, and come back later.

## How Can You Contribute? 🤔 (So Many Ways!)

There are tons of ways to help out, even if you don't feel like wrestling with JavaScript today:

### 1. Reporting Bugs 🐞 (`ItsNotAFeatureItsABug.gif`)

*   **Check Existing Issues First!** 🧐 Please browse the [Issues tab](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME/issues) (<- **Replace this link!**) to see if someone else has already reported the same bug. Don't be *that* person who creates duplicate issues. 😉
*   **Be Specific!** If you find a new bug, open a new issue. Provide as much detail as humanly possible:
    *   **What you did:** Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug. (e.g., "1. Selected text 'hello world'. 2. Right-clicked. 3. Chose 'Cheeky' mode...")
    *   **What you expected:** What *should* have happened? (e.g., "Expected cheeky text without asterisks.")
    *   **What *actually* happened:** What went wrong? (e.g., "Got text back wrapped in asterisks like **this** and it included my credit card number?!") Okay, maybe not the last one. Include error messages if you see any!
    *   **Your Setup:** Which browser version? Which Operating System? (Sometimes this matters!)
    *   **Screenshots/GIFs:** A picture is worth a thousand confused words. Show us the bug in action! 📸

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements ✨ (Shiny New Ideas!)

*   Got a brilliant idea for a new tone? A UI tweak? A completely different feature? Awesome!
*   **Check Existing Issues/Suggestions First!** Someone might have already proposed your genius idea. Add your support there!
*   **Open a New Issue:** If it's a fresh idea, open an issue. Clearly explain:
    *   **What the enhancement is:** Describe your idea in detail.
    *   **Why it's needed:** What problem does it solve? Why would users love it? (Try to convince us! 😉)
    *   **How it might work:** Any thoughts on implementation? (Optional, but helpful!)

### 3. Contributing Code 🧑‍💻 (Get Your Hands Dirty!)

*   This is the big one! If you want to fix a bug or implement a new feature yourself, that's fantastic!
*   Follow the steps below for setting up your development environment and submitting your changes via a Pull Request.

### 4. Improving Documentation ✍️ (Because READMEs Don't Write Themselves!)

*   Notice a typo? Is something unclear in the `README.md` or this very `CONTRIBUTING.md`?
*   Feel free to submit a Pull Request with documentation fixes or improvements! Clarity is king! 👑

## 🛠️ Getting Started: Your Development Setup 🛠️

Ready to code? Here's how to get set up locally:

1.  **Fork the Repository 🍴:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page (<- **Link to your repo!**). This creates your own copy under your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork 💻:** Open your terminal/Git Bash and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_FORK_NAME
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_FORK_NAME` obviously!)
3.  **No Build Step (Yay!) 🎉:** Surprise! This is a simple Chrome extension using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. There are no complex build tools or dependencies (`npm install`, etc.) required... *yet*. Muahahaha. 😈
4.  **Load into Chrome 🔧:**
    *   Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    *   Ensure "Developer mode" (top right) is **enabled**.
    *   Click "**Load unpacked**".
    *   Browse to and select the folder where you cloned the repository (the one containing `manifest.json`).
    *   The extension should now be loaded locally! ✅
5.  **Make Changes & Test! ✨:** Edit the code in your favorite editor. To see your changes, you'll usually need to go back to `chrome://extensions` and click the **reload icon** 🔄 on the extension's card. Then, refresh the web page where you're testing. (It's a bit tedious, welcome to extension development!)

## 🚀 Submitting Your Changes: The Pull Request Dance 💃🕺

Okay, you've made some amazing changes. Time to share them with the world (or at least, with us)!

1.  **Create a New Branch 🌿:** **Don't commit directly to your `main` branch!** Create a descriptive branch for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-awesome-feature-branch # Or something like `fix-asterisk-bug`
    ```
2.  **Code & Commit ✨💾:** Make your code changes. Write clear, concise commit messages (see Style Guide below). Stage and commit your work:
    ```bash
    git add . # Or add specific files
    git commit -m "feat: Add Pirate translation mode 🏴‍☠️"
    ```
3.  **Test, Test, Test! 🧪:** Seriously, does it work? Does it break anything else? Did you test different modes/inputs? Did you check the browser console for errors? Test it like your life depends on it (it doesn't, but still...).
4.  **Push Your Branch ⬆️:** Push your new branch up to *your* fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin my-awesome-feature-branch
    ```
5.  **Open a Pull Request (PR) 📬:** Go to your fork on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your new branch. Click it!
    *   **Target:** Make sure the PR is targeting the `main` branch of the *original* repository (not your fork).
    *   **Title:** Write a clear, descriptive title for your PR.
    *   **Description:** This is important! Explain:
        *   *What* changes you made.
        *   *Why* you made them.
        *   *How* you tested them.
        *   Link to any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`). This automatically links the PR to the issue.
6.  **Review & Collaborate 🙏:** We'll review your PR as soon as we can. We might ask for changes or clarification. Please be responsive to feedback! We'll work together to get it merged.
7.  **Celebrate! 🎉:** Once merged, your contribution is officially part of the project! You rock! 🤘

## ✨ Style Guides (Keepin' it Consistent-ish) ✨

### Code Style 🎨

*   **Be Consistent:** Try to match the coding style you see in the existing files (indentation, variable naming, etc.). We're mostly using standard JavaScript/HTML/CSS practices.
*   **Readability:** Write code that's easy for other humans (and your future self) to understand. Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
*   **Use `const` and `let`:** Avoid `var`.
*   **Linters/Formatters:** We don't have strict linting (like ESLint or Prettier) set up *yet*, but following general best practices is appreciated.

### Commit Messages ✍️

*   Try to follow a conventional style, it helps keep the history clean. A simple format works:
    *   `<type>: <Short description of change>`
    *   **Common types:**
        *   `feat:` (A new feature)
        *   `fix:` (A bug fix)
        *   `docs:` (Documentation changes)
        *   `style:` (Code style changes, formatting)
        *   `refactor:` (Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature)
        *   `test:` (Adding or fixing tests - if we ever add them!)
        *   `chore:` (Build process, tooling changes)
    *   **Example:** `fix: Prevent asterisks from appearing in cheeky mode output`

## ❓ Got Questions? Need Help? ❓

*   The best place to ask questions is by **opening an issue** on the repository. Tag it as a "question" if possible. This helps others who might have the same question later!
